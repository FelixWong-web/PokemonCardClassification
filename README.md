# PokemonCardClassification
Given a URL of a Pok√©mon picture we create a CNN to help predict the rarity of that card. This project was done using google Colab to easily access the file I used to download all the data, but feel free to use jupyter and uncomment out the code used to make the API calls, and comment out the the Gdown line if you want to use make specific API calls yourself.
